# Commands/Plan for Market

## Summary

 Goal: Create a system for players to put items and equipment up for sale within the guild discord.

 Initial Idea: User creates a post in market channel, if someone is interested, create a custom channel between the creator, and everyone who is interested. Eventually would like to link to an official api, later date though.

- Equipment/Drops: It would be nice to be able to post a screenshot, not sure if that is possible, otherwise I want a simple command that creates an initial embed, then seller can customize the categories/options from dropdown menus, including price, equipment type, stats, etc

- Items: Things like raw resources, or potions, or other sellable items. Created an embed and move to a separate channel.

- Buy order or request commands?
